# rebase-tutorial
For practicing the rebase workflow cycle

There are two files so that two collaborators can work on the project independently.
Let's say the project "owner" is working on issue01. They should work the rebase workflow by checking out a branch to do their work.
The colleague working on issue02 should do the same after forking, then cloning the project. Then they shoudl check out a branch to do their work on issue02

When work on issue02 is done, there should be a pull request sent from the issue02 worker.
